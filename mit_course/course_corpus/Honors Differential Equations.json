{"course_id": "18034", "course_description": ["This course emphasizes\u00a0the theory of the following topics that are covered in 18.03 in less detail.", " Study of ODE's, including modeling physical systems. Solution of first-order ODE's by analytical, graphical and numerical methods. Linear ODE's, especially second order with constant coefficients. Undetermined coefficients and variation of parameters. Sinusoidal and exponential signals: oscillations, damping, resonance. Complex numbers and exponentials. Fourier series, periodic solutions, Delta functions, convolution, and Laplace transform methods. Matrix and first order linear systems: eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Non-linear autonomous systems: critical point analysis and phase plane diagrams.
