{"course_id": "4406", "course_description": ["Ecologies of construction examines the resource requirements for the making and maintenance of the contemporary built environment. This course introduces the field of industrial ecology as a primary source of concepts and methods in the mapping of material and energy expenditures dedicated to construction activities.", "To accomplish this task, it will be useful to examine and discuss the resource consumption, environmental impacts, ecological footprint, and other ramifications of a variety of other industries as well. Also, it will be useful to place these studies within a much broader context that extends well beyond \"green\" buildings and sustainable design. By beginning with the IPAT equation, we can bring more precision - and ultimately be more effective - in assessing and developing strategies for a \"resource-lean\" society."], "course_name": "Ecologies of Construction", "course_prerequisites": []}
