Stories to be told, seen, programmed. Stories to be shared and to be shaped. Sitting around a campfire, clicking on a link, capturing on film, beating the boss, improvising on stage, being part of life.", "Don't we all have stories to tell?", "This course has been offered since 1992. Formerly entitled \"Structure and Interpretation of Non-linear and Interactive Narrative\", it examines the potential for dynamic narrative in traditional media like novels and films and as well as in computer-based stories and games. The course focuses on the creation of electronic stories and games using simple authoring systems and multimedia software tools. Students present and constructively critique one another's work in progress in a workshop setting aimed at expanding the representational powers of a new creative medium.", "Class is a mix of lectures and workshop discussion of student projects, with emphasis upon workshop discussion of assignments leading up to your final projects. Class will cover a range of topics drawn from the following: hypertext, interactive cinema, games, installation art, and soundscapes.", "Grading will be portfolio based, with a review of your creative work in three assignments, two preliminary pieces and a final, larger-scale project. Students may work on projects individually or in small collaborative groups. In-class presentations account for most of your grade. Attendance is mandatory since your discussion of student work is also a major element of this class."], "course_name": "Theory and Practice of Non-linear and Interactive Narrative", "course_prerequisites": []}
