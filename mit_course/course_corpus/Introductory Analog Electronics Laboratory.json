{"course_id": "6101", "course_description": ["6.101 is an introductory experimental laboratory that explores the design, construction, and debugging of analog electronic circuits. This subject covers diodes, transistors, JFETs, op-amps, and basic analog circuit design as applied to audio and radio frequency circuits. Students spend the second half of the term designing their own projects. Projects vary in scope and breadth, depending on students' level of prior background and interest. Past projects have ranged from simple power amplifiers to advanced noise canceling headphones.", "6.101 aims to minimize math and emphasize visual and intuitive circuit understanding, to create a practical and useful design experience. In the process, students will learn to understand and use a wide variety of analog circuits. They will learn how to use books and periodicals to find circuit ideas and to supplement their textbook knowledge. Past final projects have included:", "\nTheremin (an electronic instrument that produces sounds based on how far the user's hands are from a pair of metal rods)\nAudio mixer, effects engine, Dolby decoder, and multi-channel power amplifiers\nNoise cancelling headphones\nBeat detector and note finder\nFM modulated transmission over a power line\nLaser link audio transmitter and receiver\n400W class D full range audio amplifier\nAnalog computer\n", "The laboratory satisfies either the institute laboratory requirement or the course 6 laboratory requirement. It gives 12 Engineering Design Points. Passable performance in 6.002 or 6.071 should provide sufficient background. However, students often find it valuable to have taken more advanced circuit design classes, as they allow for more ambitious (and more interesting) final projects."], "course_name": "Introductory Analog Electronics Laboratory", "course_prerequisites": []}
