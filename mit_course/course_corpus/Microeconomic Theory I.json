{"course_id": "14121", "course_description": ["This course provides an introduction to microeconomic theory designed to meet the needs of students in the economics PhD program. Some parts of the course are designed to teach material that all graduate students should know. Others are used to introduce methodologies. Some topics of recent interest may also be covered.", "Enrollment in this course is limited and permission of the instructor is required. Permission can be obtained by attending the first class meeting and providing information about previous coursework in mathematics and economics. The course assumes that students have taken undergraduate intermediate microeconomics classes. It also assumes that students are comfortable with multivariable calculus and linear algebra and have had some exposure to real analysis. Historically, many students from outside the economics department have had difficulty with the course. The enrollment limit may result in well-qualified students being turned away."], "course_name": "Microeconomic Theory I", "course_prerequisites": []}
