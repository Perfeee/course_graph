{"course_id": "21h522", "course_description": ["The objective of this class is to introduce students to the historical development of early Japan through lectures, films and discussion of readings by Japanese authors in translation. The course surveys pre-modern Japan from the late 1100s to the mid-1800s, when Japan was governed by a warrior class. We will study the experiences of nobles and courtiers, warriors, poets, female authors, monks, and merchants in order to complement our mythic notions of an eternal Japan, characterized by samurai, swords, honor, and duty. The most distinctive feature of the course is the screening of classic Japanese feature films dealing with medieval themes. History 21H.522 thus offers not only a historical introduction to pre-modern Japanese society and culture, but also a graphic impression of how traditional society has been visualized in modern times."], "course_name": "Japan in the Age of the Samurai:  History and Film", "course_prerequisites": []}
