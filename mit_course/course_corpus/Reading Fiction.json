{"course_id": "21l003", "course_description": ["Reading Fiction is designed to sharpen your skills as a critical reader. As we explore both short stories and novels focusing on the theme of \"the city in literature,\" we will learn about the various elements that shape the way we read texts - structure, narrative voice, character development, novelistic experimentation, historical and political contexts and reader response.", "As a HASS-D, CI-H (Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences-Distribution, Communication Intensive) course, Reading Fiction is both a writing and communication intensive course. Students are required to produce at least 20 pages of polished writing with an emphasis on revision. This course will include 4 papers of 5 pages in length and 1 graded revision of a paper. The oral component of this class requires all students to actively participate in our weekly discussions on the assigned readings. These discussions are truly the backbone of the course because much of our critical thinking happens while we share ideas with one another. Each student will also be required to participate in a group presentation on one of the novels we will read in class."], "course_name": "Reading Fiction", "course_prerequisites": []}
