{"course_id": "sts005", "course_description": ["The balance between health and disease is a central feature of human life and society. Over the past 500 years there have been major changes in the prevalence and experience of diseases, from epidemics of smallpox and tuberculosis, to the chronic afflictions of obesity, heart disease, and mental illness. At the same time there has been enormous growth in the role of medicine in culture, economics, and politics. Health care is now a major sector of the American economy and it will certainly be a dominant political issue for the 21st century. This course will use a historical approach to explore the changing interactions between disease and society in America, examining: changing patterns of disease, the causes of morbidity and mortality, the evolution of medical theory and practice, the development of hospitals and the medical profession, the rise of the biomedical research industry, and the ethics of health care in America."], "course_name": "Disease and Society in America", "course_prerequisites": []}
