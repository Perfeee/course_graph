{"course_id": "21l005", "course_description": ["Drama might be described as a game played with something sacred. It tells stories that go right to the heart of what people believe about themselves. And it is enacted in the moment, which means it has an added layer of interpretive mystery and playfulness, or \"theatricality.\" This course will explore theater and theatricality across periods and cultures, through intensive engagement with texts and with our own readings.", "At the end of the course, the student will have a general overview of dramatic movements and ideas across countries and historical periods, a sense of how to write about these ideas in relation to specific texts, and a sense of why drama matters to them."], "course_name": "Introduction to Drama", "course_prerequisites": []}
