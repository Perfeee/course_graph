{"course_id": "21m734", "course_description": ["This class will explore the artistry of Lighting Design. Students will gain an overall technical working knowledge of the tools of the trade, and learn how, and where to apply them to a final design. However essential technical expertise is, the class will rather stress the artistic, conceptual, collaborative side of the craft. The class format will be a \"hands on\" approach, with a good portion of class time spent in a theatre.", "The students will be asked to take advantage of theatre in the greater Boston area, and are expected to view productions outside of the MIT campus. In addition, backstage tours at various local theatres will be arranged to illustrate how theatre architecture affects lighting design choices.", "In the Dance Theatre Ensemble's winter concert, the students will be afforded an actual design opportunity, (the final project) and will, as a team, execute a fully realized production from start to finish. This project is extremely time consuming, and work spent on it will be considered lab time.", "In addition, a series of smaller projects will be assigned including but not limited to:", "\nCompiling a Library of Interesting Lighting Images\nCreating an Emotional Storyboard to a Piece of Music\nCrafting a Simple Plot for 2 Haiku\nObserving and Collaborating with Professional Designers and Actors\nReworking a Light Plot for a Variety of Different Spaces and Situations\n"], "course_name": "Lighting Design for the Theatre", "course_prerequisites": []}
