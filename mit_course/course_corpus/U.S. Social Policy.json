{"course_id": "17317", "course_description": ["This class is divided into four sections, each of which is illustrated with case studies of various social programs. We open by discussing cultural and institutional reasons for American exceptionalism in social policy, using the case of health insurance. In the second part of the class, we begin studying policy inputs with a focus on the mass public: defining political participation, studying subgroup differences in participation rates, exploring the origins of political preferences, examining patterns of interest group organization, and discussing the nature of representative government and the theoretical relationship between participation and representation. In the third part of the course we turn to the policymaking process, studying how problems come onto the political agenda and how Congress, the courts, and the bureaucracy shape policy. Fourth, we study policy in practice: how policies are implemented; how their designs shape client experiences and subsequent policy outcomes; where we draw the line between public and private provision; and with a few final case studies how the working years, gender, and human capital formation (education) are treated by U.S. social policy. We conclude by speculating about the likely course of American social policy in the future."], "course_name": "U.S. Social Policy", "course_prerequisites": []}
