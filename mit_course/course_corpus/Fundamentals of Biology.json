{"course_id": "701sc", "course_description": ["This course focuses on the basic principles of biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, and recombinant DNA technologies. The material presented introduces modern biology at the molecular level: the structure and function of biological macromolecules, the basics of cellular metabolism, meiosis and inheritance, DNA replication, the basics of gene expression, and general recombinant DNA techniques.", "After completing the four units of this course, you should be able to:", " Identify the general structure and function of carbohydrates, phospholipds, proteins, enzymes and nucleic acids. Outline the general processes used by the cell to generate cellular energy from sugar and to generate the energy and reducing agent needed for the Calvin cycle. Describe how DNA was shown to be the genetic material and how DNA is copied. Describe the structure and regulation of genes, and the structure and synthesis of proteins. Understand the inheritance of two or more traits based upon Mendelian genetics. Apply this knowledge to drawing and decoding human pedigrees. Understand the inheritance of traits when the genes involved are linked. Predict the results of genetic crosses involving two or more traits when the genes involved are linked or unlinked. Understand the general tools and reagents used in recombinant DNA technologies. Outline a general strategy for making a recombinant DNA library, screening a recombinant DNA library, and analyzing the DNA fragment identified. Design a general strategy for identifying a gene of interest using recombinant DNA techniques.
