{"course_id": "18755", "course_description": ["After a historical motivation of the definition of a Lie group we shall develop basic manifold theory, vector fields, tangent spaces leading to the Exponential mapping for an affine connection. The exponential mapping for a Lie group emerges as a special case. The relationship between Lie subgroups and Lie subalgebras via the exponential mapping will be developed in detail. Lie's three fundamental theorems relating all finite-dimensional Lie algebras with local Lie groups will be proved via Maurer-Cartan forms and the global version by means of the Levi-decomposition. We conclude with a study of invariant differential forms on Lie groups and coset spaces, ending with some results about cohomology of Lie groups."], "course_name": "Introduction to Lie Groups", "course_prerequisites": ["These are 18.100B (Analysis and Metric Spaces) and 18.700 (Linear Algebra). The course\u00a018.101\u00a0(Calculus in Several Variables) would be useful and some familiarity with topological groups\u00a0is also helpful."]}
