We rely on 6.450 to build the connection between a real-life communication channel and its digitized models, so that we can focus almost exclusively on the digital designs in the current course. We also require fluency in the main structures and concepts of digital communication systems, as well as the associated probabilistic analysis.", "We expect students to have some experience in linear algebra and probability. You are recommended to review and evaluate yourself on your fluency using the following textbooks.", "Bertsekas, Dimitri P., and John N. Tsitsiklis. Introduction to Probability. Belmont, MA: Athena Scientific Press, June 2002. ISBN: 188652940X.", "Strang, Gilbert. Linear Algebra and Its Applications. 3rd ed. Pacific Grove, CA: Brooks Cole, 1998. ISBN: 0155510053.", "We do not require the knowledge of information theory. Although a large portion of the course has information theoretic flavor, we will develop the necessary concepts as we encounter them. However, it is certainly helpful if you have already taken, or are currently taking, 6.441."]}
