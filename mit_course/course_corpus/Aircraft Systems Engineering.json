{"course_id": "16885j", "course_description": ["Aircraft are complex products comprised of many subsystems which must meet demanding customer and operational lifecycle value requirements. The subject adopts a holistic view of the aircraft as a system, covering: basic systems engineering; cost and weight estimation; basic aircraft performance; safety and reliability; lifecycle topics; aircraft subsystems; risk analysis and management; and system realization. Small student teams \"retrospectively analyze\" an existing aircraft covering: key design drivers and decisions; aircraft attributes and subsystems; operational experience. Oral and written versions of the case study are delivered.", "At the completion of 16.885, students will have gained:", "\nAn appreciation of an aircraft as a system, operating within a larger air transportation or air defense system, and comprised of many subsystems\nUnderstanding of, and ability to apply, basic concepts for:\n\nSystems Engineering: Requirements, Interface mgmt, Verification and Validation\nCost and Weight Analysis and Estimation\nPerformance Analysis\nReliability and Safety\nThe Function, Architecture and Key Performance Issues of Major Subsystems\nRisk Analysis and Management\nDesign Closure to Deliver Lifecycle Value\n\n\nAn ability to understand complex systems and design choices through the retrospective analysis of existing aircraft systems\n"], "course_name": "Aircraft Systems Engineering", "course_prerequisites": []}
