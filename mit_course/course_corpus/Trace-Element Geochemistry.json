{"course_id": "12479", "course_description": ["The course consists of a series of lectures introducing the field of Trace Element Geochemistry including a review of partition coefficients and theoretical approaches to understanding trace element partitioning during partial melting and fractional crystallization. Throughout the course, lectures are interspersed with papers that are to be read by students and discussed during class. A listing of papers to be discussed is included but unfortunately the interactive class discussions emerging from reading these papers cannot be reproduced in a Web-based course."], "course_name": "Trace-Element Geochemistry", "course_prerequisites": []}
