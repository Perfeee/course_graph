{"course_id": "18901", "course_description": ["The objectives of this course are four:", " To explore the foundations of mathematics (logic and set theory) at a level and depth appropriate for someone aspiring to study higher-level mathematics and/or to become a professional mathematician. To present an introduction to the field of topology, with emphasis on those aspects of the subject that are basic to higher mathematics. To introduce the student to what it means to do mathematics, as opposed to learning about mathematics or to learning to do computational exercises. To help the student learn how to write mathematical text according to the standards of the profession. "], "course_name": "Introduction to Topology", "course_prerequisites": ["The prerequisite for the course is a first course in Analysis, at the level of Rudin's \"Principles of Mathematical Analysis\" (18.100B here at MIT.) This background is essential both for the knowledge of the subject matter and for the experience in formulating proofs."]}
