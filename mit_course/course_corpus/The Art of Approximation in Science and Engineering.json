{"course_id": "6055j", "course_description": ["This course teaches simple reasoning techniques for complex phenomena: divide and conquer, dimensional analysis, extreme cases, continuity, scaling, successive approximation, balancing, cheap calculus, and symmetry. Applications are drawn from the physical and biological sciences, mathematics, and engineering. Examples include bird and machine flight, neuron biophysics, weather, prime numbers, and animal locomotion. Emphasis is on low-cost experiments to test ideas and on fostering curiosity about phenomena in the world."], "course_name": "The Art of Approximation in Science and Engineering", "course_prerequisites": ["The prerequisites for this course are Physics I (8.01 Mechanics, GIR)\u00a0and Calculus I (18.01 Single Variable Calculus, GIR). A dose of curiosity and open-mindedness to attack problems about which you know little are recommended."]}
